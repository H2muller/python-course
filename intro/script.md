# CPSC 499

Hi, and welcome to CPSC 499, Python for Bioinformatics. My name is Hans, and I will be your instructor for this course.


This course is offered completely asyncrhonously, so you should be able to watch the videos and progress the course contents at your own pace.

#

First things first, don't get intimidated by the code behind me. If you don't understand anything from what you see in the background, that is totally okay.


I've written the concepts I will go over today as a Python code, to get you familiarized with what the format that will be used in this course will look like. The lectures will be hands on, and for the most part you will be seeing this interface in the background.


By the time you finish this course, I encourage you to come back to this video and take a second look at these slides, and you should be able to understand all the contents without problems.


No previous coding knowledge is required to take this course.

This course will be divided in modules that share a common theme. Although the course is asynchronous, it is important that you go through the content in the provided order, without skipping anything.

To help maximize your learning experience, each video lecture will be followed by a quiz, and completing the quiz will unlock the next video. Once you complete all quizzes in a module, the next module will become available.


To unlock module 1, make sure you complete the Setup Instructions, linked below [link].


This course has three main learning objectives:


First, you will become familiar with the command line. There is no reason to be intimidated by the terminal... The terminal is your friend, and you will learn how to use it to your advantage.


Next, you will learn the basics of Python: the data types, the code structure, basic functions and how to write basic scripts... Then, as you master the basics, you will learn some of the more complex concepts that will allow you to write more robust scripts and automations.


Finally, you will learn how to apply your newly acquired knowledge to Data Science, with practical examples that you may be familiar with.

For your grades, you will find that some of the modules will contain assignments that need to be completed, and a course project will be unlocked as part of your course progression.


Since the course is asynchronous, the deadline for all assignments and course project are the end of the semester, but I strongly recommend that you start early.


The assignments and course project will be graded automatically. You will have unlimited attempts, and only the most recent grade will be recorded for each assignment. Each assignment will have a weight of ONE, and the course project will have a weight of FOUR, to account for the complexity. Your final grade will be the weighted average of the grades for your assignments and course project. You should be able to get an easy A as long as you start early.


Oh... there is one more thing: to prepare you for what programming will be like in real life, you will have access to the log after each submission, and you will have to fix the errors in your own code before the next attempt.
